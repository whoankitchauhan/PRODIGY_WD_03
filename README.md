## Features

### 1. Play Modes

Choose between playing against a friend or against the computer. The game supports two-player mode for friendly matches and a single-player mode against a computer opponent.

### 2. Stylish Design

The game features a responsive and visually appealing design. Each move triggers a subtle animation, and hover effects provide a delightful user experience.

### 3. Reset Game

Reset the game at any time with the "Reset Game" button. This allows players to start a new game or correct mistakes during play.

### 4. Computer Opponent

In single-player mode, the computer opponent makes random moves. The game logic ensures a challenging experience for players.

## Code Structure

- **HTML (`index.html`):** Defines the structure of the game, including the game board, buttons, and message displays.

- **CSS (`styles.css`):** Provides styles for the game elements, ensuring an attractive and responsive layout.
